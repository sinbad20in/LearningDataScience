The data is organized for each volunteer based the activities which they performed and the metrics captured during the activities.

The tidy data attached here has the following variables.

Activity
-------------
It enlists the six activities found in the raw data which includes
 LAYING 
 SITTING 
 STANDING 
 WALKING 
 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

Volunteer ID
----------------------
These are integers depicting the 30 volunteers who participated in the program.


The following variables indicate the mean of the measurement metrics for each subject
