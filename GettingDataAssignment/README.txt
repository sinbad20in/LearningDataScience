As described in the assignment, the raw data was 

1. Merged with  the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labelled the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The approach adapted is clearly documented in the script. The cookbook contains the names of the variables and the value captured in them. The output file is in txt format which could be read into R or worksheet too.
